# Bangle Detection Project


This project is designed to detect and classify bangles in video frames using a YOLO object detection model. The code leverages the `ultralytics` library for YOLO object detection and OpenCV for video processing and visualization. The goal is to identify and classify bangles as either "good" or "broken" based on the trained model's predictions.


## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- Ultralytics YOLO
- A pre-trained YOLO model (`bangel.pt`)

  ### How to install requirements
`
pip install -r requirements.txt
`
### How to run source code
`
python `bangleProj.py
